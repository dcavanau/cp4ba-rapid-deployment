# Step 10: Optional: Create new VM for RPA & install IBM RPA

![Overview](images/overview10.jpg "Overview")

1. Follow **[Create new VM for LDAP  &  install IBM SDS  &  import ldif file with users and groups](03createVMForLDAP.md)** to request a new VM. Please note the following differences:
   
   - OS: use Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2016
   - Private Security Group and Public Security Group: do NOT select anything, or the password of administrative user will not be created
   
   After the VM is created, you can add "allow_all" to both security groups

2. Follow **[IBM RPA SaaS client installation document](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/20.12?topic=installation-saas-client)** to install RPA SaaS client
