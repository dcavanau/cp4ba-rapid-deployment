# Step 4: Deploy IBM DB2 Containers & create needed databases

![Overview](images/overview04.jpg "Overview")

1. On your bastion host create a new directory for the scripts needed and switch to it
   
   **Note:** As part of this doc, it is assumed that you create new directory `/cp4ba`. If you select a different directory, you have to change some of the commands in this and following steps accordingly, otherwise you can simply copy/paste them.
   
   ```
   mkdir /cp4ba
   ```
   
   ```
   cd /cp4ba
   ```
   
2. Clone this git repository onto your bastion host, extract an archive and copy the deployment scripts
   
   **Note:** As part of this doc, it is assumed that you copy the deployment scripts into directory `mycluster`. If you select a different directory, you have to change some of the commands in this and following steps accordingly, otherwise you can simply copy/paste them.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-rapid-deployment
   ```
   
   ```
   cd /cp4ba/cp4ba-rapid-deployment/cp4ba-22-0-1-IF3
   ```
   
   ```
   unzip scripts/deployment-db2-cp4ba/baca-db/DB2/imports/runtime_page.del.001.lob.zip -d scripts/deployment-db2-cp4ba/baca-db/DB2/imports
   ```
   
   ```
   cp -r scripts mycluster
   ```
   
   ```
   cd mycluster/deployment-db2-cp4ba
   ```
   
3. Optional: Dependent on the CP4BA template selected in **[Step 0: Select the CP4BA template for deployment](00selectTemplate.md)**, get a DB2 Standard Edition license key to enable containerized DB2 to use more CPUs and RAM compared to the Community Edition
   
   **Note:** In case you don't have access to a DB2 Standard Edition license key, you can install DB2 with the Community Edition license that is included by default. But, this might result in issues when deploying some of the provided CP4BA templates later on, as it might happen that the CPE Object Stores can't be automatically initialized while the deployment as the DB connections might not be able to be created. In that case, scale down the operator to zero after the Object Store initialization failed and create the missing DB connections manually. Then, scale up the operator to one and it will successfully initialize the Object Stores.
   
   - On PPA or XL SW, search for part number CC36WML and download DB2_DSE_Activation_11.5.zip
   - Extract db2std_vpc.lic from the archive (can be found in DB2_DSE_Activation_11.5.zip/std_vpc/db2/license)
   - Base64 encode your Db2 license by running the following commands:
     
     ```
     LICENSE_KEY="./db2std_vpc.lic"
     ```
     
     ```
     cat ${LICENSE_KEY} | base64 | tr -d '\n'
     ```
     
   - Save the encoded output, as you will add it to your properties file in the next step
   
   **Note:** More background on this topic can be found here: **https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/db2/docs/content/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.server.doc/doc/c0061199.html**

4. In folder **/cp4ba/cp4ba-rapid-deployment/cp4ba-22-0-1-IF3/mycluster/deployment-db2-cp4ba** update the properties file for DB2, **01-parametersForDb2OnOCP.sh**, and provide the following properties:
   
   - `cp4baTemplateToUse` - Name of CP4BA deployment template that will be used e.g. `ibm_cp4a_cr_template.002.ent.FoundationContent.yaml`
   - `db2OnOcpProjectName` - Namespace where DB2 should be installed e.g. `ibm-db2`
   - `db2AdminUserPassword` - Password that will be assigned to the db2 instance user e.g. `passw0rd`
   - `db2StandardLicenseKey` - provide the encoded license key from previous step if needed, otherwise leave empty, means remove the default value `REQUIRED`
   - `db2Cpu` - Number of CPUs for DB2 pod according to the selected CP4BA template
   - `db2Memory` - Amount of memory for DB2 pod according to the selected CP4BA template
   
   Also review the other properties, in case changes are needed, e.g., if you are not deploying on ROKS, specify `cp4baDeploymentPlatform=OCP` and also provide the `db2OnOcpStorageClassName` available on your own OpenShift cluster (must be RWX). For ROKS a `db2StorageSize` of `500Gi` is optimal as the size also defines the IOPS. If you are not deploying on ROKS and your storage provider gives you good IO speed with smaller storage size, you can reduce that value to `150Gi`.

5. If not done already, login to your OCP cluster through OC CLI, for example:
   
   ```
   oc login --token=<your-token> --server=https://<your-server>:<your-port>
   ```
   
   **Note:** You can copy the login command from the OCP Web console.
   
   Verify that the version of the OC CLI and cluster version are similar:
   
   ```
   oc version
   ```
   
   Sample output:
   
   ```
   oc version
   Client Version: 4.8.0-202111041632.p0.git.88e7eba.assembly.stream-88e7eba
   Server Version: 4.8.26
   Kubernetes Version: v1.21.6+bb8d50a
   ```
   
   **Note:** If the version is not similar, download the appropriate OC CLI and install it on your bastion host.

6. Run script **02-createDb2OnOCP.sh**. This script will install and configure DB2 for you.
   
   ```
   ./02-createDb2OnOCP.sh
   ```
   
   If the script displays the following banner **all** DB2 components have been deployed and configured properly.
   
   ```bash
   *********************************************************************************
   ********* Installation and configuration of DB2 completed successfully! *********
   *********************************************************************************
   ```

   After this banner is displayed it is possible for the script to fail on some post deployment clean up work.  Failing the cleanup work does not impact the successful deployment and configuration of DB2.

   **Notes:**
   - To successfully run the script you need the **jq tool** and **podman** installed - if not yet installed, install them before running the script
   - You need your **Entitlement Registry key** handy, see also **[Step 1: Create your IBM Cloud Account (or use existing)](01createIBMCloudAccount.md)**
   - This script will exit if errors are hit during the installation.
   - This script is idempotent. If it fails, you can run it a second time.
   
   Sample script output:
   ```
   ./02-createDb2OnOCP.sh
   
   Found 01-parametersForDb2OnOCP.sh.  Reading in variables from that script.

   Use this hostname/IP to access the databases e.g. with IBM Data Studio.
   Please also update in 01-parametersForDb2OnOCP.sh property "db2HostName" with this information (in Skytap, use the IP 10.0.0.10 instead)
     Hostname: <your-hostname>
     Other possible addresses(If hostname not available above): <your-addresses>
   
   Use one of these NodePorts to access the databases e.g. with IBM Data Studio (usually the first one is for legacy-server (Db2 port 50000), the second for ssl-server (Db2 port 50001)).
                   "nodePort": <your-http-port>,

   Db2u installation complete! Congratulations. Exiting...
   ```

7. Run script **03-createCp4baDBs4Db2OnOCP.sh** to create the databases needed for the CP4BA template that you selected
   
   ```
   ./03-createCp4baDBs4Db2OnOCP.sh
   ```
   
   **Note:** You can ignore the following errors / warnings:
   
   ```
   DB21034E  The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a
   valid Command Line Processor command.  During SQL processing it returned:
   SQL0554N  An authorization ID cannot grant a privilege or authority to itself.
   SQLSTATE=42502
   ```
   
   and
   ```
   SQL1363W  One or more of the parameters submitted for immediate modification
   were not changed dynamically. For these configuration parameters, the database
   must be shutdown and reactivated before the configuration parameter changes
   become effective.
   ```
   
   **Note:** In case you got errors **creating** DBs, please use script **99-dropCp4baDBs4Db2OnOCP.sh** to drop all DBs - then re-run script **03-createCp4baDBs4Db2OnOCP.sh**

   **Note:** In case you got errors **activating** DBs, please use script **04-activateDBs.sh** to try to activate them again - if your DB2 pod got enough memory assigned (e.g., `110Gi` for the Client Onboarding template) and you are using a DB2 Standard Edition license, activation of all DBs should be successful

   **Note:** In case you are not using the DB2 Standard Edition license or have assigned less memory to DB2 than specified for the selected CP4BA template, it might happen that not all databases got activated which might lead to other issues later while the deployment of CP4BA

8. Review the output of the script and make sure there were no errors, all databases got created and activated
   
9. Optional: If your selected template includes ADP, run script **08-createAdpDBs4Db2OnOCP.sh** to create the databases for ADP
   
   ```
   ./08-createAdpDBs4Db2OnOCP.sh
   ```
   
   Review the output of the script and make sure there were no errors, all databases got created and activated
