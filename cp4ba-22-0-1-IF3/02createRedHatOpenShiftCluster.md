# Step 2: Create new RedHat OpenShift Cluster

![Overview](images/overview02.jpg "Overview")

1. Access **https://cloud.ibm.com** with your IBM ID

2. Select the account under which to create the new RedHat OpenShift Cluster
   
   ![Select Account](images/selectAccount.jpg "Select Account")

3. In the top-left corner, click on the **Navigation Menu** icon
   
   ![Navigation Menu](images/navigationMenu.jpg "Navigation Menu")

4. In the Navigation Menu select **OpenShift -> Clusters**
   
   ![Clusters](images/requestNewRoksCluster01.jpg "Clusters")
   
5. Click **Create cluster**

6. Select the appropriate **OpenShift Version**, 4.8.26 or a newer 4.8.x version
   
   **Note:** IBM Automation SWAT team tested only with OCP version 4.10.x, we recommend to not use older OCP versions.

7. As OCP entitlement, select **Apply my Cloud Pak OCP entitlement to this worker pool** (as this will reduce the costs for the cluster)
   
   ![OpenShift Version and entitlement](images/requestNewRoksCluster02.jpg "OpenShift Version and entitlement")
   
8. Select the **Infrastructure**, e.g., Classic

9. Select the **Geography** where you want to run your cluster, e.g., Europe

10. Set the **Availabilty** to **Single zone** (Multizone is only required for disaster recovery)

11. Select the **Worker zone** (datacenter) where the cluster should be created, e.g., Frankfurt 04
    
    ![Location](images/requestNewRoksCluster03.jpg "Location")
    
12. Select the **worker pool flavor**, the **amount of workers** needed and deselect **Encrypt local disk**
    
    - Select a worker pool flavor that fulfills the OCP Cluster sizing requirements of the previously selected CP4BA template (see **[Step 0: Select the CP4BA template for deployment](00selectTemplate.md)**)
    - Select the amount of workers that fulfills the OCP Cluster sizing requirements of the previously selected CP4BA template. If you plan to scale up the deployment (deploy with a pod replica size of 2 or 3 for High Availability) more workers/resources are needed. Optionally you can start with a replica size of 1 first and then scale up when needed - first add more workers and then increase the pod replica size, see also **[Step 11: Optional: Scale up the deployment](11scaleUp.md)**
    - Local disk encryption is not needed as we only work with sample / test data
    
    **Notes:** To save costs, you also can select Virtual - shared nodes, this is sufficient for running the Client Onboarding Demo with one or only a few users in parallel for demo purposes. Same is true for the amount of workers, when you plan to run the Demo only with one user, usually no HA is needed. If you plan to use this OpenShift cluster for higher workloads / multiple users, means you require High Availability and better/best performance, you might want to select Virtual - dedicated or even Bare metal machines and also select an higher amount of workers / a flavor that gives you more resources per worker.

13. Make sure the permissions checker reports no errors and provide the **Cluster name**

    ![Cluster name](images/requestNewRoksCluster06.jpg "Cluster name")

    Optionally deselect available integrations as this is only a Demo / Enablement environment
    
    ![Integrations](images/requestNewRoksCluster061.jpg "Integrations")

14. Review the Summary on the right hand side and click **Create**

15. Monitor the creation of your new ROKS cluster, it usually will take up to one hour to fully provision it (if you selected Bare metal, it also can take longer, dependant on the HW availability in the selected data center)

As you by default will be running DB2 containerized on the OpenShift cluster, you might need - dependent on the previously selected CP4BA template - one worker node with more memory (see **[Step 0: Select the CP4BA template for deployment](00selectTemplate.md)**) - if this is the case for your selected CP4BA template, complete the remaining sub-steps, otherwise you can proceed with **[Step 3: Create new VM for LDAP, install IBM SDS & import ldif files with users and groups](03createVMForLDAP.md)**
    
16. Once the first worker nodes are up and running, navigate to your cluster, in the Navigation Menu select **OpenShift -> Clusters**
    
    ![Clusters](images/requestNewRoksCluster07.jpg "Clusters")
    
17. Select the cluster, e.g., tech-jam-emea, and open the **Worker pools**
    
    ![Worker pools](images/requestNewRoksCluster08.jpg "Worker pools")
    
18. Click **Add**

19. Provide the **Worker pool name**, e.g., db2worker, and select the same **Worker zone** as selected before, e.g., Frankfurt 04 
    
    ![Worker pool name and zone](images/requestNewRoksCluster09.jpg "Worker pool name and zone")
    
20. Select a **woker pool flavor** that provides you the amount of memory needed for DB2 according to the selected CP4BA template
    
    ![Worker pool flavor for DB2](images/requestNewRoksCluster10.jpg "Worker pool flavor for DB2")

21. Set the **amount of workers** to **1**, deselect **Encrypt local disk**, select **Apply my Cloud Pak OCP entitlement to this worker pool** and make sure the permissions checker reports no errors

22. Review the Summary on the right hand side and click **Create**

23. Monitor the creation of your additional worker

## What to do next

Once the ROKS cluster is created, you can proceed with the next step: **[Step 3: Create new VM for LDAP, install IBM SDS & import ldif files with users and groups](03createVMForLDAP.md)**
