# Welcome at the cp4ba-rapid-deployment project!

In this repository you can find doc, scripts and templates for rapid Enterprise deployment of **IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation** (CP4BA).

These scripts can be used to set-up the infrastructure needed for the **IBM Automation SWAT Client Onboarding Demo** and also other CP4BA enterprise installation patterns.

**IMPORTANT:** The primary use for those scripts and templates is for rapid set-up of CP4BA DEMO and ENABLEMENT environments, for example to host the Client Onboarding Demo. Those scripts and templates shoud not be used to set-up customer environments for development, test, pre-production or production as they might have for example stronger security requirements. For such deployments, pls. use the official CP4BA documentation that can be found here: **https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation**

**IMPORTANT:** Opening a Case against official IBM Support due to issues with these scripts or issues with the results of these scripts is not supported. Instead, IBMers can use this IBM internal Slack channel: **#dba-swat-asset-qna** (**https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C026TD1SGCA**), everyone else can open a new issue in this github.
