# Step 5: Install IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation Operator & deploy IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation (Production)

![Overview](images/overview05.jpg "Overview")

1. Onto your bastion host, download the Case package: **<https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/raw/master/repo/case/ibm-cp-automation-4.0.1.tgz>** into a temporary directory, e.g., `/temp`, and extract `ibm-cp-automation-4.0.0.tar` into the same temporary directory, e.g., `/temp`

2. Extract the content of `ibm-cp-automation-4.0.0.tar` into the same temporary directory, e.g., `/temp`

3. Extract the content of archive `/temp/ibm-cp-automation/inventory/cp4aOperatorSdk/files/deploy/crs/cert-k8s-22.0.1.tar` into directory `/cp4ba`

4. If you are deploying on a ROKS cluster, copy the modified storage class definitions so that CP4BA Operator is using them (in this version of the storage classes the reclaimPolicy got changed to Delete and the name got adapted, because Delete is usually the better reclaimPolicy for ROKS and Demo environments)

   ```
   cp /cp4ba/cp4ba-rapid-deployment/cp4ba-22-0-1/mycluster/deployment-db2-cp4ba/cp4a-*-storage-class.yaml /cp4ba/cert-kubernetes/descriptors/
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   cp /cp4ba/cp4ba-rapid-deployment/cp4ba-22-0-1/mycluster/deployment-db2-cp4ba/cp4a-*-storage-class.yaml /cp4ba/cert-kubernetes/descriptors/
   cp: overwrite ‘cp4ba/cert-kubernetes/descriptors/cp4a-bronze-storage-class.yaml’? y
   cp: overwrite ‘cp4ba/cert-kubernetes/descriptors/cp4a-gold-storage-class.yaml’? y
   cp: overwrite ‘cp4ba/cert-kubernetes/descriptors/cp4a-silver-storage-class.yaml’? y
   ```

5. From cert-kubernetes, execute script **cp4a-clusteradmin-setup.sh**

   ```
   cd /cp4ba/cert-kubernetes/scripts/
   ```

   ```
   ./cp4a-clusteradmin-setup.sh
   ```

   Storage classes are needed to run the deployment script. For the Starter deployment scenario, you may use one (1) storage class.
   For an Production deployment, the deployment script will ask for three (3) storage classes to meet the slow, medium, and fast
   storage for the configuration of CP4A components.  If you don't have three (3) storage classes, you can use the same one for
   slow, medium, or fast.  Note that you can get the existing storage class(es) in the environment by running the following
   command: oc get storageclass. Take note of the storage classes that you want to use for deployment. 
   NAME                                  PROVISIONER         RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE   ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
   cp4a-file-delete-bronze-gid           ibm.io/ibmc-file    Delete          Immediate           false                  2m
   cp4a-file-delete-gold-gid (default)   ibm.io/ibmc-file    Delete          Immediate           false                  2m
   cp4a-file-delete-silver-gid           ibm.io/ibmc-file    Delete          Immediate           false                  2m
   <your-list-of-storage classes>
   ```

   The progress of the script can be monitored on a separate terminal by checking the output of the command

   ```
   watch -n 10 oc get pvc,csv,pod
   ```

   First you should see that the two persistent volume claims are get bound. Then the deployment of the 9 operators can be seen, and last but not least, the 9 pods implementing those operators should be getting deployed and running.

6. Wait until all Operators are installed, this might take a while (you need to see e.g. 9 pods in \<your-ibm-cp4ba-project\>, 12 pods in ibm-common-services project, all Running and Ready 1/1)

   **Note:** The number of pods can vary based on when you install and what version of the Operators is installed. Important is that all are Running and Ready.

7. In folder **deployment-db2-cp4ba** update the properties file for CP4BA **05-parametersForCp4ba.sh**, provide the following properties:

   - `cp4baProjectName`, e.g., `ibm-cp4ba` - make sure to use the same value as used before when running script cp4a-clusteradmin-setup.sh
   - `cp4baTlsSecretName` - see also secret name in project ibm-cert-store on ROKS, if you are not deploying on ROKS leave empty
   - `cp4baAdminPassword`, e.g., `passw0rd` - use the password for user cp4badmin in the generated .ldif file when setting up LDAP
   - `ldapAdminPassword`, e.g., `passw0rd` - use the password that you specified for cn=root when setting up LDAP
   - `ldapServer`, e.g., `123.456.679.012` - the hostname or IP of the previously installed LDAP server

   **Note:** Also review the other properties, in case changes are needed, e.g., in case you are not deploying on ROKS, also provide correct Storage Class values for properties `cp4baScSlow`, `cp4baScMedium` and `cp4baScFast`. These Storage Classes have to provide RWX storage, for more details about storage for CP4BA, see also **<https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/22.0.1?topic=ppd-storage-considerations>**.

8. Run script **07-createCp4baDeployment.sh**

   ```
   cd /cp4ba/cp4ba-rapid-deployment/cp4ba-22-0-1/mycluster/deployment-db2-cp4ba
   ```

   ```
   ./07-createCp4baDeployment.sh

9. The deployment of CP4BA might now take several hours dependant on the CP4BA template that you selected. Monitor the logs of the Operator to spot any potential issues.

   **Note:** In case you have not used a DB2 Standard Edition license key or enough memory for the DB2, closely monitor the operator logs. This configuration might result in issues when deploying CP4BA, as it might happen that the CPE Object Stores can't be automatically initialized while the deployment as the DB connections might not be able to be created. In that case, scale down the operator to zero after the Object Store initialization failed and create the missing DB connections manually. Then, scale up the operator to one and it will usually initialze the Object Stores.

10. The CP4BA deployment is complete when you see:
    - for template **Client Onboarding Demo with ADP**: in your **CP4BA project** about 84 Running and Ready pods, and about 39 Completed pods, but no Pending / CrashLoopBackOff pods, plus in project **ibm-common-services** about 37 Running and Ready pods, and about 5 Completed pods, but no Pending / CrashLoopBackOff pods
    - for template **Foundation, Content**: in your **CP4BA project** about 30 Running and Ready pods, and about 10 Completed pods, but no Pending / CrashLoopBackOff pods, plus in project **ibm-common-services** about 32 Running and Ready pods, and about 5 Completed pods, but no Pending / CrashLoopBackOff pods
    - for template **Foundation**: in your **CP4BA project** about 26 Running and Ready pods, and about 10 Completed pods, but no Pending / CrashLoopBackOff pods, plus in project **ibm-common-services** about 32 Running and Ready pods, and about 5 Completed pods, but no Pending / CrashLoopBackOff pods

    **Note:** It might be that some pods are in Failed or Error state, for those make sure there is another instance of that pod in Completed state. If this is the case, you can delete the Failed or Error pods. If there are pods in Failed or Error state where there is no other instance of that pod in Completed state, the deployment is not healthy.

    **Note:** It might be that going forward the number of pods mentioned here does change, as with every new installation latest versions of ibm-common-services and IBM Automation Foundation are installed and those latest versions might come with a different number of Running and / or Completed pods. The most important point here is that you don't see pods in any other state (Pending / CrashLoopBackOff / Failed / Error / ...).

    For example, when you selected the Template **Foundation, Content**, you shoud see the following:

    ![CP4BA deployment](images/cp4baDeployment01.jpg "CP4BA deployment")

    ```
    oc get pods

    ```

11. Now that the deployment is complete, you need to apply some post-deployment steps. First post-deployment step is to enable you to log in with the users from LDAP. For this, first get the user ID and password of the zen admin user by running those two commands:

    ```
    oc -n ibm-cp4ba get secret ibm-iam-bindinfo-platform-auth-idp-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.admin_username}' | base64 -d && echo
    ```

    ```
    oc -n ibm-cp4ba get secret ibm-iam-bindinfo-platform-auth-idp-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.admin_password}' | base64 -d && echo
    ```

    **Note:** By default the user id is **admin**

12. Open the **cpd** route

    ![Open the cpd route](images/cp4baDeployment02.jpg "Open the cpd route")

13. Accept the self-signed certificates (two times)

14. On the **Log in to IBM Cloud Pak** screen, select **IBM provided credentials (admin only)**

15. Log in using the zen admin user credentials

16. Click **Manage users**

17. Select the **User groups** tab and click **New user group**

18. Enter name **cp4bausers** and click **Next**

19. On the **Users** page select **Identity provider groups**, search for **cp4bausers**, select it and click **Next**

20. On the **Roles** page select roles **Automation Analyst** (needed for Process Mining), **Automation Developer** (needed for CP4BA, for example to access BAStudio) and **User**, then click **Next**

21. On the **Summary** page review the selections and click **Create**

22. Select the **Users** tab and click **cp4badmin**

23. Click on **Assign roles**, select all roles and click **Assign**

24. Log out with the zen admin user

25. Second post-deployment step is to verify that users from LDAP can log-in. For this, back on the **Log in to IBM Cloud Pak** page, first select **Change your authentication method** and then **Enterprise LDAP**

26. Log in with **cp4badmin** which is a user from LDAP (password can be found in property **cp4baAdminPassword** above in properties file **05-parametersForCp4ba.sh**)

27. Verify that cp4admin now has full administatative access to zen: **cp4badmin** schould also see the **Manage users** option, in the hamburger menu the entry **Administration**, and if you selected a template that deploys BAStudio also the entry **Design**

28. Gather the cluster's URLs from config map **icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info** and test that all URLs work

**Note:** The remaining post-deployment steps are only needed if you want to access the system with one of the usr*** IDs - if this is not the case, proceed with sub-step 48 below

29. Third post-deployment step is to allow users from LDAP to author Process Applications. For this, from the config map open the URL for **Business Automation Workflow Authoring Portal** in a new Browser tab

30. Change the context root from **/ProcessPortal** to **/ProcessAdmin** to open the Process Admin Console (it will open without asking for userId / password as you are already logged in as cp4badmin)

31. Expand **User Management** and select **Group Management**

32. In the field **Select Group to Modify** enter **tw_a** and first select group **tw_authors**

33. On the right-hand side click **Add Groups**

34. Search for **cp4bausers**, select that LDAP group and click **Add Selected** to add it to **tw_authors**

    **Note:** It might take a few seconds until the group appears. Wait till it appears automatically.

35. Second, similarly as in the previous three steps, add LDAP group **cp4bausers** to **tw_admins** - once complete you can close the Browser tab with Process Admin Console

36. Fourth post-deployment step is to modify the App Designer toolkits. For this, switch back to the Browser tab where you are logged in to IBM Cloud Pak

37. In the top-left corner open the hamburger menu and select **Design -> Business applications**

38. Click **Toolkits -> UI** and switch to the **Collaborators** tab

39. Remove **tw_authors** and add **tw_allusers** with **Read** access instead

40. In the top-left corner click the **Back** arrow

41. Apply the same change to toolkit **System Data**

42. In the top-left corner open the hamburger menu, expand **Administration** and select **Repository and registry access**

43. On the **Collaborators** tab add group **cp4bausers** and give them **Edit** access

44. Fifth post-deployment step is to allow the users to create Case solutions. For this, from the config map open the URL for **Business Automation Case Client** in a new Browser tab

45. In the URL change the desktop from **baw** to **bawadmin** to open the Case administration UI

46. On the left-hand side, select the **BAWDOS** ObjecStore, expand **Project Areas** and select **dev_env_connection_definition**

47. Switch to the **Security** tab, add group **cp4bausers**, click **Finish** and click **Close**- once complete you can close the Browser tab with Case administration UI

48. Optional: Set the subscription of all installed Operators to **Manual**
